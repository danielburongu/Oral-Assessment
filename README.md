## Temperature Converter (React Class Component in TypeScript)

-  The TemperatureConverter component is a class-based React component written in TypeScript that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. It manages the current temperature and scale (Celsius or Fahrenheit) as part of its state. The component provides input fields for each temperature scale and dynamically converts the value based on user input. It also includes buttons to switch between the conversion modes, demonstrating state management and basic form handling in a React class component.

## LinkedList Class (TypeScript)
-  The LinkedList class in TypeScript models a dynamic data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The class includes methods to manipulate the list: add() inserts a new node at the end, remove() deletes a node by value, and find() searches for a node. This implementation showcases essential operations for handling linked lists, such as node traversal and manipulation.
